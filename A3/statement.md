# Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic
Arbitrary-Precision arithmetic, also known as "bignum" or simply "long arithmetic" is a set of data structures and algorithms which allows to process much greater numbers than can be fit in standard data types. In this assignment you will write an efficient  program to implement "bignum".

Your program should support the following:

[**Mandatory** for the assignment to be deemed complete [50% of marks]] addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

[**Optional** [for the remaining 50%]] Square Root, abs, power(exp)

It should also work for negative numbers. You can use either sign magnitude or two's complement that you are have learnt/will learn in computer architecture course to do the assignment.

It should also support fractions (decimals).

This will be the basis for extending the codebase to support complex numbers when we do the next assignment.

More details about what to submit will be added during the weekend along with the test cases.
